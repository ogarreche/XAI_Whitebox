# XAI_Whitebox
Whitebox methods

DeepLift is applied by using Shap.deepExplainer. See reference: https://shap-lrjball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.DeepExplainer.html

For LRP and IG. See Innvestigate: https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate


Note: for importing environment see the Importing Environments section https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html 


### Example: 

1 - Run the DNN_NSL_Example.ipynb for instructions.

    The program Loads the NSL-KDD dataset, trains a DNN model, and apply IG, LRP and DeepLift. It outputs the Accuracy of the model and the most important lists for each one the XAI methods with its relative score.
